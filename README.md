## Beacon setup
You will need 3 beacons to be geolocate.
Put 3 frames like this :

```
      North
       ╔ ╗
       ╚ ╝
       ╔ ╗╔ ╗
West   ╚ ╝╚ ╝  East

       South
```    
       
Put a beacon in the center of each frame.
The frame size is 2 meters, so you have 3 beacons spaced out by 2m :
- North beacon toward north
- East beacon toward east
- Origin beacon

Rename those beacons.

You can now be pinpoint.
